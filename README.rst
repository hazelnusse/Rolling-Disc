Rolling Disc Equations of Motion
================================

In this work, I present the derivation of the equations of motion for a
knife edged disc rolling without slip.  The ultimate goal is to have clear
derivations explicitly demonstrated using Kane's method, Lagrange's method,
the Newton-Euler method, and Hamilton's method.  The motivations for this
process are pedagogical; it is my hope that clear, concise, and complete
derivations of system with interesting dynamics will help to illustrate the
subtleties and differences associated with each approach.
