Rolling Disc Equations of Motion
================================

In this work, I present the derivation of the equations of motion for a
knife edged disc rolling without slip.  The ultimate goal is to have clear
derivations explicitly demonstrated using

1. Kane's method
2. Lagrange's method
3. Newton-Euler method
4. Hamilton's method.

The motivations for this process are pedagogical; it is my hope that clear,
concise, and complete derivations of system with interesting dynamics will help
illustrate the subtleties and differences associated with each approach.  Also,
I hope to illustrate the subtleties of rolling in a clear straightforward way.
